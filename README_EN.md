# MCP RAG Proof of Concept ‚Äî Oil & Gas Prototype

This project is a Proof of Concept for **Multi Context Protocol (MCP) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** in the oil and gas industry.
The application connects multiple internal domains (drilling, production, HSSE, purchase orders, timeseries, and RAG search) into a single router, so client queries can be automatically routed to the right service/repository.

---

## What is MCP?

**Multi Context Protocol (MCP)** is a protocol that connects LLMs with various tools or services behind the scenes.
With MCP, a user‚Äôs question can automatically be mapped to a specific domain (e.g., drilling events, purchase orders, or RAG search) and executed in the most appropriate way.

## What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** combines the reasoning power of LLMs with document-based retrieval.
Instead of relying solely on the model, RAG fetches relevant text snippets from a database (e.g., `doc_chunks`) and uses them to produce more accurate, citation-backed answers.

---

## üõë The Problem

In the oil & gas industry, operational data is scattered across many domains and siloed systems:

* **Drilling** ‚Üí drilling reports & Non-Productive Time (NPT).
* **Production** ‚Üí daily production data & timeseries.
* **HSSE** ‚Üí incident logs & safety reports.
* **Purchase Orders** ‚Üí procurement status & vendor details.
* **Technical documents** ‚Üí fragmented PDFs/Word files across departments.

As a result, answering a single simple question (e.g., *‚ÄúHow many HSSE incidents occurred on rig B07 this month?‚Äù*) requires:

* Contacting multiple teams/departments.
* Searching for reports manually.
* Waiting for validation and data consolidation.

This process can take **days** and is prone to inconsistencies between sources.

---

## ‚úÖ The Solution

The **MCP + RAG** project offers a modern approach:

* **MCP Router** ‚Üí acts as a *smart gateway* that directs user queries to the right domain/data repository (drilling, production, HSSE, PO, timeseries).
* **RAG Search** ‚Üí combines *keyword search (BM25)* and *semantic search (cosine similarity)* to fetch the most relevant document chunks.
* **LLM Integration** ‚Üí understands user queries in natural language and returns context-based answers, complete with citations.
* **Chat SSE** ‚Üí responses are streamed interactively, like chatting with an AI assistant.

### Benefits for oil & gas companies:

* ‚è± **Faster** ‚Üí cross-domain answers in seconds.
* üìä **More accurate** ‚Üí document-based answers with verifiable citations.
* üîÑ **More efficient** ‚Üí reduced cross-departmental coordination burden.
* üß© **More flexible** ‚Üí easy to extend with additional tools/domains.

### Summary

Monorepo PoC for MCP + RAG in an oil & gas case study.
Key features:

* MCP Router & Tools (PO, Production, Drilling, Timeseries, NPT).
* Hybrid RAG (BM25 + cosine) via `/rag/search_v2` (MySQL doc\_chunks).
* Document-based answers (`answer_with_docs`) with citations.
* Chat SSE (`/chat/stream`): planning ‚Üí normalize ‚Üí execute ‚Üí stream.
* Plan normalizer (auto-switch rag\_search\_v2, Top-N PO by amount).
* Ready-to-use REST endpoints.
* Configurable via ENV; optional OpenAI integration for LLM/embeddings.
